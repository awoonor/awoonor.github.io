The recent advances in computer technology has revolutionized our core understanding of the structure, bonding, and reactivity of molecular systems, providing novel insights into biological processes occurring in living organisms.<sup>(1)</sup> Computer simulations ideally bridge the gap between the micro- and macroscopic worlds, and have over the years made tremendous contributions to chemistry, biochemistry, enzymology, and biophysics.<sup>(2)</sup> 

A myriad of biological processes depend on [enzyme catalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis), whose understanding at the molecular level is of central significance. [Enzymes are extraordinary biomolecules essential to life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme), with a catalytic prowess that has inspired almost half a century of scientific research. Despite the advances made in the nature of enzymatic catalysis,<sup>(3)</sup> a complete understanding of the factors that govern the roots of their rate enhancements and selectivity remains elusive, and are subjects of considerable debate and discussion. Thus, a deeper understanding of their atomistic details and origins is of great practical and fundamental importance(<sup>(4)</sup> in unraveling the mysteries behind their catalytic power. 

[Computer simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation) ideally can play a key role in deciphering the nature of enzymatic reactions. In light of this, the emergence of multiscale models like the combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method has been a huge advancement in the field. These methods which are increasingly at the forefront of elucidating the mechanisms behind enzyme-catalyzed reactions,<sup>(5,6)</sup> have led to a more holistic picture of enzymatic catalysis.<sup>(4)</sup> The [QM/MM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QM/MM) method in particular, describes a chemical system using different levels of approximation by combining both the accuracy of a [quantum mechanical description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) with the efficiency of [Newtonian molecular mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mechanics). More generally, the method treats different parts of a complex biological system on different time scales. The method has over the years gained immense popularity and in 2013, its critical contribution to the field of computational chemistry & biochemistry was recognized with a [Nobel Prize](http://www.nobelprize.org/);<sup>(7)</sup> awarded to [Martin Karplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Karplus), [Michael Levitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levitt) and [Arieh Warshel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arieh_Warshel) for “[the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2013/)”.

In fact, the QM/MM method has been critical to advances in computational enzymology,<sup>(8)</sup> specifically in the understanding of core principles underlying [enzyme catalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis),<sup>(9-12)</sup> which undoubtedly stands as one of the greatest challenges in modern-day biochemistry and biophysics.
