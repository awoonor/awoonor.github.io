This blog will address issues of personal interest and research. Views and opinions are typically my own. 
My interests lie in medicinal chemistry but is not limited to that scope. I follow popular science websites like <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/" target="_blank">Chemistry World</a>, <a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/" target="_blank">The Naked Scientists</a> and <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/" target="_blank">Derek Lowe's popular blog on drug discovery and the pharma industry</a>.
