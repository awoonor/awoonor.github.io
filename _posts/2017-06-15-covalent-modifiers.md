Covalent drugs are drug molecules that attach to their targets by forming a strong chemical bond. Lately, there has been increasing interest in these drugs owing to their potency, sustained target engagement, and efficacy in many clinical indications like cancer. Anticancer drugs like [ibrutinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrutinib "ibrutinib"), [afatinb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib "afatinib"), [neratinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neratinib "neratinib"), [osimertinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osimertinib), and [dacomitinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasatinib) are common examples. However, drugs employing this mode of inhibition are not limited to treating only cancer. In fact, [penicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin "Penicillin") and [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin "aspirin") are classic examples of day-to-day drugs that achieve their effects by covalent inhibition.

In my opinion, covalent binding drugs are the future of modern therapeutics. Despite the historical [concerns about idiosyncratic toxicities and the likelihood of off-target effects](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/31/watch-your-covalent-drugs-carefully), these drugs are continually gaining traction in regulatory approval by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) (FDA). To date, there are [over 40 FDA approved covalent drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/List-of-FDA-approved-drugs-that-form-covalent-interactions-with-targets_tbl1_274251591).


One example of this class of drugs is [kinase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor). Kinase inhibitors are drug molecules that inhibit protein kinase enzymes which are implicated in cancer cell proliferation and signalling. In the past few decades, there has been [over 20 approved kinase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor) by the U.S. FDA. As of February 2020, the U.S. FDA has approved [52 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31862477). Kinase inhibitor drug discovery as a result has garnered wide attention from research labs and industry. The number of research articles and reviews on the topic has more than doubled in the past decade or so.
