*I use computer software to identify druggable sites in enzyme targets whose malfunction can lead to pathophysiological mechanisms in diseases like cancer, diabetes, and inflammation. To simply put, I am looking at how we can employ the power of computer software to speed up the process of drug discovery, so that we can develop relatively cheap, safe, and effective medicines for patients. The process of developing a safe and effective drug for disease treatment is expensive and costs billions of dollars. The advancement in computer technology, speed, and algorithm offers an opportunity to expedite the process of drug discovery. This will provide new insights into developing novel, efficacious, and life-changing medicines for patients who are in dire need for treatment.*

### *Selected Research Projects*

* ***Covalent Modification of Proteins***:  I have made a significant effort to test, develop, and apply state-of-the-art computational tools and methods to predict the druggability of cysteine residues in proteins (_J. Chem. Theory Comput._ **2016**, 12, 4662; _Biochim. Biophys. Acta - Proteins Proteomics_, **2017**, 1865, 1664; _J. Chem. Inf. Model._ **2018**, 58, 1935; _J. Comput. Chem._ **2020**, 41, 427;  _J. Chem. Inf. Model._ **2021**, 61, 5234). The information from this research has led to an improved understanding of modelling the covalent modification of targetable residues in enzyme targets and provided some important directions for method improvement that would greatly benefit drug hunters in the field. Furthermore, this knowledge can be applied to modeling a vast array of targets in oncology and beyond, — and could help guide the design of breakthrough therapies for disease treatment. Covalent inhibitors are also currently being pursued as potential treatments for COVID-19 (e.g., <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19" target="_blank">Pfizer’s Paxlovid</a> ) and I am employing some of the methods developed during my PhD to help with ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19 (_Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys_., **2021**, 23, 6746,   <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/61b0b4987ada950e376d9233" target="_blank">ChemRxiv</a>)


* ***Membrane Permeation***: Biological membranes serve as the barrier between cells and their environment, so the passage of drugs, toxins, metabolites, and signaling molecules across them is central to the metabolism and control of the cellular component. To cross from the extracellular solution to the cytosol in the cell membrane, solutes must pass through a non-polar paraffinic membrane interior. I co-authored a comprehensive invited review on membrane permeation (_BBA Biomembranes_, **2016**, 1858, 1672), focusing on best practices and outstanding issues in membrane permeation simulation methods. This review has been influential in the field of membrane biology, accruing over 100 citations since its publication. In addition, I have also contributed to developing a method to accurately calculate the rates of solute diffusion inside membranes (_J. Chem. Theory Comput_., **2016**, 12, 5609), which has been distributed as a freely available code to the scientific community.


* ***Free Energy Calculations and QM/MM Methods***: Many chemical systems can be modelled by combining the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the efficiency of molecular mechanics. We have used this method to gain accurate models of the solvation of ionic species in liquid water (Awoonor-Williams and Rowley, _J. Chem. Phys_. **2017**, 146, 034503; Awoonor-Williams and Rowley, _J. Chem. Phys_. **2018**, 149, 045103), so as to understand their toxicological effects and biochemical roles.




<!-- Cancer kills <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics" target="_blank">8.2 million people each year</a>. The <a href="http://www.who.int/cancer/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> warns of a 70% increase in the occurrence of new cases by 2035. Although numerous strides and research effort have gone into its treatment and cure, the disease continues to pose a major threat to the lives of most humans. One reason is that drugs developed for its treatment have limited efficacy and specificity. In other words, these drugs generally tend to be less potent in suppressing the rather aggressive nature of most cancers and often have unpleasant side-related effects like incessant diarrhea. Common drugs employed in cancer treatments work under the principle of inhibiting proteins, which are molecules that underpin every aspect of biological activity including cell growth and division. A vast majority of current targetted anticancer drugs work by inhibiting kinase proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation. However, due to the structural similarity of most kinase proteins, an anticancer drug can react with multiple kinase proteins other than its intended target, causing severe side effects. --->

<!--My research project focuses on identifying specific sites of reactivity in protein kinase cells to help develop more selective and efficacious anticancer drugs. More specifically, my project involves developing new computer modeling techniques to identify and accurately predict the reactivity of active sites in proteins for drug synthesis. This will provide drug developers and pharmaceutical chemists with new insights into designing and developing more potent and effective anticancer drugs for therapeutic purposes. The fundamental goal of my research is to improve the therapeutic potency of anticancer drugs, while reducing the time and cost needed for their design and development.
