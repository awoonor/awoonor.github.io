Ernest completed his B.Sc (Hons) degree at <a href="https://www.mta.ca/" target="_blank">Mount Allison University</a> under the supervion of <a href="https://www.mta.ca/Community/Bios/Khashayar_Ghandi/Khashayar_Ghandi/" target="_blank">Prof. Khashayar Ghandi</a> in 2014. Ernest's honours research focussed on muonium free radical chemistry in green solvents, particularly supercritical carbon dioxide. This research combined both computational and experimental approaches, with the latter carried out with researchers at <a href="http://www.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">TRIUMF National Laboratory</a> in Vancouver, BC.
 
In September 2014, Ernest moved to St. John's, NL to pursue graduate studies in Chemistry at <a href="http://www.mun.ca/" target="_blank">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a>. He is currently a PhD candidate in the department of Chemistry and  works with a group of talented researchers at the centre for molecular simulation and computational modeling in the <a href="https://www.rowleygroup.net/group/" target="_blank">Rowley Computational Chemistry Group</a>. His PhD research focusses on the reactivity of cysteine residues in protein kinases. The ultimate goal of this research is to identify druggable cysteines in these regulatory enzymes for therapeutic interventions. Ernest holds an NSERC <a href="http://www.vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html" target="_blank">Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship</a> and is an <a href="https://www.ace-net.ca/wiki/ACENET_Research_Fellowship_Program" target="_blank">ACEnet fellow</a>.
