I am PhD candidate in the department of Chemistry at <a href="http://www.mun.ca/" target="_blank">Memorial University</a>. I work at the centre for molecular simulation and computational modeling in the <a href="http://www.chem.mun.ca/homes/cnrhome/group_page/main.html" target="_blank">Rowley Computational Chemistry Group</a>, where I am developing computer modeling tools to design more potent and selective anticancer drugs. I am particularly interested in all matters concerning drug design and discovery.
