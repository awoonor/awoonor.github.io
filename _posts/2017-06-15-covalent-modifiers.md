Covalent binding drugs which are drug molecules that attach to their targets by forming a strong chemical bond 
are the future of modern therapeutics, in my opinion. Well, that should be the case if off-target effects and cross-reactivity 
issues of these drugs can be minimized. Medicinal Chemists and pharmaceutical chemists tend to stay clear of these drugs 
or chemical moieties that could emulate covalent binding of targets due to idiosyncratic toxicity issues.
