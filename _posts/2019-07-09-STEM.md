Recently, I was nominated by the [dean of Graduate Studies, Dr. Aimée Surprenant](https://www.mun.ca/sgs/contacts/dean.php) to be recognized in the Inspiring Diversity in STEM (IDSTEM) community. [IDSTEM](https://www.inspiringdiversityinstem.com) is a grassroots movement based in [London, Ontario](https://www.london.ca/Pages/default.aspx) that works to recognize and support individuals from underrepresented minority groups in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

Below is an excerpt of my featured profile. ***The full profile can be found [here](https://www.inspiringdiversityinstem.com/traineeprofiles).***


**What do you research and what are your current research goals?**

In my research, I am developing new computer modelling tools to design better medicines. One particular approach is using computer software to identify druggable targets in proteins— to assist drug developers and medicinal chemists in designing better drugs for therapeutic purposes. The ultimate goal of my research is to enhance the efficacy of pharmaceutical drugs, particularly for cancer treatment purposes.


**Who or what originally got you into STEM?**

I had very good teachers and mentors in high school who were passionate about science and encouraged me to pursue a career in STEM-related fields. I also enjoyed most of my science and math courses in high school and university. Pursuing my interests coupled with good mentorship got me into STEM.


**What advice would you give to other young trainees in STEM from minority groups?**

I would encourage young trainees to follow their passion and believe in their abilities. Know that a career in STEM or any other field for that matter is possible and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. It is important to have good mentors and role models who are committed to your success.
