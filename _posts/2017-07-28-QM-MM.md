Covalent drugs are drug molecules that attach to their targets by forming a strong chemical bond. Lately, there has been increasing interest in these drugs owing to their potency and efficacy in many clinical indications like cancer. Anticancer drugs like [ibrutinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrutinib "ibrutinib"), [afatinb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afatinib "afatinib") and [neratinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neratinib "neratinib") are common examples. However, drugs employing this mode of inhibition are not limited to treating only cancer. In fact, [penicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin "Penicillin") and [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin "aspirin") are classic examples of day-to-day drugs that achieve their effects by covalent inhibition. 

In my opinion, covalent binding drugs are the future of modern therapeutics. Despite the historical concerns about idiosyncratic toxicities and the likelihood of off-target effects, these drugs are continually gaining traction in regulatory approval by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) (FDA). One example of this class of drugs is [kinase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor). Kinase inhibitors are drug molecules that inhibit protein kinase enzymes which are implicated in cancer cell proliferation and signalling. In the past few decades, there has been [over 20 approved kinase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_kinase_inhibitor) by the U.S. FDA. Kinase inhibitor drug discovery as a result has garnered wide attention from research labs and industry. The number of research articles and reviews on the topic has more than doubled in the past decade or so.

This list is not at all comprehensive, but it highlights the wealth of information currently available about this important class of drugs. *I will do my best to add more to the above list if I come across any new content.*
