Ernest completed his B.Sc (Hons) degree at <a href="https://www.mta.ca/" target="_blank">Mount Allison University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mta.ca/Community/Bios/Khashayar_Ghandi/Khashayar_Ghandi/" target="_blank">Prof. Khashayar Ghandi</a> in 2014. Ernest's honours research focussed on muonium free radical chemistry in green solvents, particularly supercritical carbon dioxide. This research combined both computational and experimental approaches, with the latter carried out with researchers at <a href="http://www.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">TRIUMF National Laboratory</a> in Vancouver, BC.
 
In September 2014, Ernest moved to St. John's, NL to pursue graduate studies in Chemistry at <a href="http://www.mun.ca/" target="_blank">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a>. He completed his Ph.D. in Computational Biochemistry in May 2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.rowleygroup.net/blogpi/2017/7/1/christopher-rowley" target="_blank">Prof. Christopher Rowley</a>. His PhD research explored the use of computational methods in modelling the covalent modification of druggable cystienes in enzyme targets. During his Ph.D., Ernest was awarded the prestigious NSERC <a href="http://www.vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html" target="_blank">Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship</a> and an <a href="https://www.ace-net.ca/wiki/ACENET_Research_Fellowship_Program" target="_blank">Advanced Research Computing Fellowship</a> by <a href="https://www.ace-net.ca/" target="_blank">ACENET</a>.

Currently, Ernest is working as a Reasearch Assistant II in the <a href="https://www.rowleygroup.net/" target="_blank">Rowley Group at Memorial University</a>. He is actively seeking postdoctoral and job opportunities in the area of computer-aided drug design and discovery.
