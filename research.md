Cancer kills <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics" target="_blank">8.2 million people each year</a>. The <a href="http://www.who.int/cancer/en/" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> warns of a 70% increase in the occurrence of new cases by 2035. Although numerous strides and research effort have gone into its treatment and cure, the disease continues to pose a major threat to the lives of most humans. One reason is that common drugs developed for its treatment have limited efficacy and specificity. In other words, these drugs generally tend to be less potent in suppressing the rather aggressive nature of most cancers and often have unpleasant side-related effects like incessant diarrhea. Common drugs employed in cancer treatments work under the principle of inhibiting proteins, which are molecules that underpin every aspect of biological activity including cell growth and division. A vast majority of current targetted anticancer drugs work by inhibiting kinase proteins involved in cancer cell proliferation. However, due to the structural similarity of most kinase proteins, an anticancer drug can react with multiple kinase proteins other than its intended target, causing severe side effects.

My research project focuses on identifying specific sites of reactivity in protein kinase cells to help develop more selective and efficacious anticancer drugs. More specifically, my project involves developing new computer modeling techniques to identify and accurately predict the reactivity of active sites in proteins for drug synthesis. This will provide drug developers and pharmaceutical chemists with new insights into designing and developing more potent and effective anticancer drugs for therapeutic purposes. The fundamental goal of my research is to improve the therapeutic potency of anticancer drugs, while reducing the time and cost needed for their design and development.
